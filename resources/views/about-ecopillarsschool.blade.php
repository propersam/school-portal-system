                            <p>Founded on September 6, 2015, Eco-pillars reiterated her commitment to nurturing children to compete favourable with the best in the world. <strong>"To compete with the 'best' in the world, we have to give them access to the best instructions"......</strong> The Managing Director of Eco-pillars opined during the unveiling of the school.</p>
                            <p>Leaders and builders of tomorrow's empires need to be equipped to take their rightful places in the scheme of life. They need nurturing and grooming that will put them in the forefront to face the global challenges of our today's reality of life.  Eco-pillars school provides the right platform to 'groom' these leaders and builders. The entire grooming and adornment of the children in Eco-pillars is timelessly faultless, their dress sense suburb,  their style quirky but suave and their whole demeanor splendid and outstanding. </p>
                            <p><span > In a nutshell, 'discipline' is a core part of the school culture and it is emphasized right from 'pre-admission stage'. We have zero tolerance for indiscipline. We frequently remind our pupils and staff that,  one of the pillars of 'greatness' is discipline. That is why our motto........  "Learning for Greatness " is chosen. </span></p>
